<body>Don't forget to submit this assignment!  It would be sad if you did all the work and didn't receive a grade because you forgot to turn it in... ^_^ Make sure you also double check the class definition of a word!  You decided that hyphen-separated strings count as two separate words, and to keep abbreviations with internal periods such as Ph.D. as a single word.</body>
